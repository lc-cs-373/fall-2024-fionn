# Parsing in PLCC

Here we will learn to use PLCC's command-line tools to compile and run the
parser for a given grammar.  To get started, position your terminal in the
`05-parsing` directory.  Remember, the dollar sign is the prompt; so don't type
it.

```bash
$ cd activities/05-parsing
```

`sentence.grammar` contains a small grammar for an overly simplified English
sentence.  Feel free to inspect its contents.  To generate a parser for this
grammar, run `plccmk` on the file.  You should see something like the following.

```bash
$ plccmk sentence.grammar
Nonterminals (* indicates start symbol):
  <noun>
 *<sentence>
  <subject>
  <verb>

Abstract classes:

Java source files created:
  Noun.java
  Sentence.java
  Subject.java
  Verb.java
```

Note the classes that PLCC generated and the start symbol.  Also take a look at
the contents of `Java/`.  Notice that (among others) PLCC also generated
`Scan.java`.  `Scan.java` contains the scanner as before.  Let's test our
scanner as we did in the previous activity.  There is a `test1.sentence` file
that we can use to test it.

```bash
$ scan < test1.sentence
   1: WORD 'this'
   1: WORD 'is'
   1: WORD 'an'
   1: PERIOD '.'
```

Looking again in `Java/` we also find `Parse.java`.  This contains the parser.
Let's run it on the same file.  This time we use PLCC's `parse` command.

```bash
$ parse < test1.sentence
--> OK
-->
```

By default, when ran directly, the parser tells us if the file contains a valid
"program" based on the grammar.

1. In a file named `test2.sentence`, write an invalid "program" and run
   the parser on it.  Note the error it reports.

By passing `-t` to the parse command, we can get it to print a trace of its
parsing process.  Let's also pass `-n` to get rid of the `-->` that it produces.

```bash
$ parse -t -n < test1.sentence
   1: <sentence>
   1: | <subject>
   1: | | <noun>
   1: | | | WORD "this"
   1: | <verb>
   1: | | WORD "is"
   1: | <noun>
   1: | | WORD "an"
   1: | PERIOD "."
OK
```

Notice that this trace has the same structure as the parse tree that the parser
generates.  In fact, that's why a parse tree is called a parse tree.  Printing
the parser's trace can be useful when debugging a BNF grammar or when
implementing semantics.
