## First-class functions

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-class_function): A
programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats
functions as first-class citizens.  This means the language supports *passing*
functions as arguments to other functions, *returning* them as the values from
other functions, and *assigning* them to variables or storing them in data
structures.
