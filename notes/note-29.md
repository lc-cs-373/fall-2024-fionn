# PLS Fall 2024 Note 29

## Statically- vs. dynamically-typed

Static type checking is the process of verifying type safety at compile time.
Dynamic type checking is the process of verifying type safety at runtime.

## Strongly vs. weakly typed

There is no precise definition of what it means to be strongly or weakly typed.

A weakly typed language has looser typing rules and may produce unpredictable or
even erroneous results or may perform implicit type conversion at runtime.

In Luca Cardelli's article Typeful Programming, a strong type system is
described as one in which there is no possibility of an unchecked runtime type
error.
